## Modules
The following modules are going to be needed to run this program (in python3.7)  
- re
- socket
- pygames
- unittest
- sys
- random

You should have everything with a normal install, but pygames. all you need  
for that is just do a `pip3.7 install pygame`. just make sure your in admin mode  
so you have the correct permission. VScode gets funny with that stuff
